Description: Generation of domain variables,
  linearisation of several nonlinera population statistics
  (the ratio of two totals,
    weighted income percentile,
    at-risk-of-poverty rate,
    at-risk-of-poverty threshold,
    Gini coefficient,
    gender pay gap,
    median income below at-risk-of-poverty gap,
    income quintile share ratio,
    relative median at-risk-of-poverty gap),
  computation of regression residuals in case of weight calibration,
  variance estimation by the ultimate cluster method
    (Hansen, Hurwitz and Madow, 1953).
  Several other precision measures are derived - standard error,
    the coefficient of variation,
    the margin of error,
    confidence interval,
    design effect.
